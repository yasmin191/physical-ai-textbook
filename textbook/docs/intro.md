# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## From Digital Brain to Physical Body

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** course. This course represents the frontier of artificial intelligence—where AI systems transition from digital environments into the physical world.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using:

- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2)
- **Gazebo** and **Unity** for simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac** platform for AI-powered robotics

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
2. **Master** ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
3. **Simulate** robots with Gazebo and Unity
4. **Develop** with the NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
5. **Design** humanoid robots for natural interactions
6. **Integrate** GPT models for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into **4 modules** aligned with a 13-week curriculum:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (Weeks 1-5)
Focus on ROS 2 middleware for robot control, including nodes, topics, services, and URDF.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)
Focus on physics simulation and environment building with Gazebo and Unity.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (Weeks 8-10)
Focus on NVIDIA Isaac for advanced perception, training, and navigation.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (Weeks 11-13)
Focus on the convergence of LLMs and robotics, including the capstone project.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey with [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI](/module-1-ros2/intro-physical-ai).

## Hardware Requirements

This course requires specific hardware for optimal learning. See [Appendix A: Hardware Setup](/appendices/a-hardware-setup) for detailed requirements.

:::tip Quick Start
If you're new to robotics, start with the [Ubuntu & ROS 2 Installation Guide](/appendices/b-ubuntu-ros2-install) to set up your development environment.
